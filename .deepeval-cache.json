Each labelled llama-dataset is comprised of its associated labelled examples. With examples, we make predictions with the appropriate object depending on the task. After making predictions, we can evaluate the performance of the object by measuring some distance between predictions and the corresponding references.IntroA few weeks back, we launched our very first set of llama-datasets, namely the LabelledRagDataset. The main purpose of these llama-datasets is to provide builders with the means to benchmark their LLM systems in an effective and efficient manner. In the couple of weeks since that launch date, we\\u2019ve amassed over a dozen LabelledRagDatasets via both staff and community contributions (all of which are available for download through LlamaHub)!The fun doesn\\u2019t stop there though: today we\\u2019re introducing two new llama-dataset types: LabelledEvaluatorDataset and the LabelledPairwiseEvaluatorDataset. These new llama-dataset types are meant for evaluating or benchmarking an LLM evaluator. Indeed, the adopted standard for evaluating LLM responses is to use a strong LLM as an evaluator. This approach is certainly more scalable, faster, and cheaper than using human evaluators via crowdsourcing. However, these LLM evaluators themselves must also be continuously evaluated rather than blindly trusted.In this post, we provide a brief overview of the new llama-datasets as well as provide some very interesting results from benchmarking Google\\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\\u2019s GPT models as LLM evaluators on the MT-Bench datasets which we\\u2019ve converted into the new llama-dataset types.A primer on the new llama-datasetsBefore getting into the new llama-datasets, recall that with LabelledRagDataset our end goal was to use it to evaluate or benchmark a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The way to do that with our llama-dataset abstractions is to build a QueryEngine (i.e., a RAG system) and then use it to make \\u201cpredictions\\u201d over the LabelledRagDataset. With the predictions in hand, we can evaluate the quality of these predictions by comparing it to the corresponding reference attributes of the LabelledRagDataset.Benchmarking flow with LabelledRagDataset. With a query engine, predictions are made over every labelled example. We can then compare predicted responses and contexts with the reference versions (i.e., labels). This flow is conveniently handled via the RagEvaluatorPack.In a similar vein, the new llama-datasets are meant to benchmark an LLM evaluator. Let\\u2019s go through the first kind, the LabelledEvaluatorDataset. Here, instead of the RAG system making predictions on a LabelledRagDataset we have an LLM evaluator making \\u201cpredictions\\u201d over a LabelledEvaluatorDataset \\u2014 predictions in this context means that the LLM evaluator is evaluating the response produced by another LLM model to a given query. As before, with the predictions in hand, we can measure the goodness of the LLM evaluator\\u2019s evaluations by comparing it to the corresponding reference attributes of the LabelledEvaluatorDataset.Benchmarking flow with LabelledEvaluatorDataset. With a supplied evaluator, predictions are made over every example. In this context, a prediction is an evaluation of the answer to the query and optional contexts and ground truth answer. With these predictions in hand, we can evaluate how good the evaluations are by comparing them to the reference feedbacks and scores. A llama-pack called EvaluatorBenchmarkerPack makes benchmarking a one-liner.The second llama-dataset we\\u2019re introducing today can be considered an extension of the first one. The LabelledPairwiseEvaluatorDataset is similarly used for benchmarking an LLM evaluator. However, there is a subtle difference in the evaluation task as here the LLM evaluator compares two generated answers from two separate LLMs. Outside of this difference, the flow for using this llama-dataset to benchmark an evaluator remains the same.Benchmarking flow with LabelledPairwiseEvaluatorDataset. With a supplied evaluator, predictions are made over every example.\", \"For a comprehensive code walkthrough, we recommend visiting our Google Colab Notebook.Download DatasetWe will use the Llama2 paper dataset from Llama Datasets which contains 100 questions and their reference answers.from llama_index.llama_dataset import download_llama_dataset\\n\\nllama2_rag_dataset, llama2_documents = download_llama_dataset(\\n    \\\"Llama2PaperDataset\\\", \\\"./data/llama2\\\"\\n)Define Prometheus LLM hosted on HuggingFace And OpenAI for creating an Index (RAG) pipelineWe need to host the model on HF Inference endpoint using Nvidia A100 GPU, 80 GB RAM.from llama_index.llms import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI\\nimport os\\n\\nHF_TOKEN = \\\"YOUR HF TOKEN\\\"\\nHF_ENDPOINT_URL = \\\"HF END POINT URL\\\"\\n\\nprometheus_llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI(\\n    model_name=HF_ENDPOINT_URL,\\n    token=HF_TOKEN,\\n    temperature=0.1,\\n    do_sample=True,\\n    top_p=0.95,\\n    top_k=40,\\n    repetition_penalty=1.1,\\n)\\n\\nos.environ[\\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\\"] = \\\"YOUR OPENAI API KEY\\\"\\n\\nfrom llama_index.llms import OpenAI\\n\\ngpt4_llm = OpenAI(\\\"gpt-4\\\")Prompt templates.We will use the same prompts for the Prometheus model and GPT-4 to make consistent performance comparisons.Correctness Evaluation Prompt:prometheus_correctness_eval_prompt_template = \\\"\\\"\\\"###Task Description: An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a query, a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given. \\n   1.

However, the open-source Prometheus model has recently emerged as a notable alternative for such evaluation tasks.In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to effectively use the Prometheus model for evaluation purposes, integrating it smoothly with the LlamaIndex framework by comparing it with GPT-4 evaluation. Our primary focus will be on assessing RAG using our standard metrics: Correctness, Faithfulness, and Context Relevancy. To provide a clearer understanding, here\\u2019s what each metric entails:Correctness: Assesses whether the generated answer aligns with the reference answer, given the query (this necessitates labeled data).Faithfulness: Measures if the answer remains true to the retrieved contexts, essentially checking for the absence of hallucinations.Context Relevancy: Evaluate the relevance of both the retrieved context and the answer to the query.For an in-depth exploration, our documentation is available here.For those who are exploring the Prometheus model for the first time, the paper summary by Andrei is an excellent resource to gain a better understanding.A crucial aspect to remember when using the Prometheus model is its dependence on rubric scores within the prompt for effective evaluation. An example of such Rubric scores in the context of Correctness Evaluationis as follows:###Score Rubrics: \\nScore 1: If the generated answer is not relevant to the user query and reference answer. \\nScore 2: If the generated answer is according to reference answer but not relevant to user query. \\nScore 3: If the generated answer is relevant to the user query and reference answer but contains mistakes. \\nScore 4: If the generated answer is relevant to the user query and has the exact same metrics as the reference answer, but it is not as concise. \\nScore 5: If the generated answer is relevant to the user query and fully correct according to the reference answer.You\\u2019ll find comprehensive details on this in the prompts section of this tutorial.For a detailed walkthrough of the code, feel free to follow along with our Google Colab Notebook accompanying this blog post. In the notebook, we conducted evaluations on both the Paul Graham Essay Textand the Llama2 Paper.

The context clearly states that Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), was developed and released. It also mentions that these models range in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Furthermore, the context confirms that these models are optimized for dialogue use cases. Therefore, the information provided is accurate and is corroborated by the context. [RESULT] YESGPT-4 Faithfulness Score: 1.0GPT-4 Relevancy Feedback: The response accurately reflects the context provided. The response correctly identifies the two primary objectives of the work as the development and release of Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), and the optimization of these models for dialogue use cases. This is in line with the information provided in the abstract of the context. The response also correctly states the range of parameters for the large language models developed as being from 7 billion to 70 billion, which is also confirmed in the context. Therefore, the response is in line with the context information provided. [RESULT] YESGPT-4 Relevancy Score: 1.0Observation:Prometheus: If you compare the feedback and contexts, there is mention of a range of parameters in the context and response but the feedback says the model could not find such information.GPT-4: Evaluates it correctly, unlike the Prometheus model.SummaryThe cost for evaluation (approx.): $1.5 for Prometheus Model and $15 for GPT4.The Prometheus model, though offering more detailed feedback than GPT-4, occasionally provides incorrect feedback, necessitating cautious application.If a generated answer lacks certain facts present in the reference answer, the Prometheus model applies stricter penalties to scores than GPT-4.The faithfulness and relevancy feedback of Prometheus shows more hallucinations/ wrong interpretations in the feedback compared to GPT-4.Note:You can check detailed analysis with code on Google Colab Notebook.The endpoint on HF is served on AWS Nvidia A100G \\u00b7 1x GPU \\u00b7 80 GB which costs $6.5/h. (We extend our gratitude to the Hugging Face team for their assistance whenever we encounter issues.)We used the Prometheus model for the analysis here. We also made a similar analysis with the GPTQ Quantized version of the Prometheus model and observed a bit more hallucinations in feedback compared to the original unquantized model. Thanks to the authors of the paper for open-sourcing the model and Tom Jobbins for the quantized version of the model.References:Prometheus paper.Prometheus model on HuggingFace.\", \"Specifically, in the original dataset, there are some replications with respect to the triple (query, model A, model B) examples since for some of these more than one human evaluation was provided. Since our prompt allows the LLM evaluator to deem a tie, and to our knowledge, this wasn\\u2019t made an option for the human evaluators, we have aggregated the results across the different human evaluations to get the proportion of times model A wins versus model B for each triple (query, model A, model B). We then say that human evaluators deem a tie if the proportion lies between 0.4 and 0.6. It should be emphasized here that the reference evaluations are provided by humans, and so the benchmark metrics that we produce and share here represent the LLM agreement with humans.(We skip showing the code snipped to produce the results here, because they\\u2019re essentially the same as the previously shared code snipper with the exception of requiring a PairwiseComparisonEvaluator instead of a CorrectnessEvaluator.)Benchmark ResultsInvalid_predictions are as defined in the previous benchmark. Inconclusive\\u2019s represent the case when an LLM evaluator flips its winner after prompting it with the same evaluation task but instead flipping the order of presentation of the two answers (i.e. to mitigate against position bias). Two agreement rates, with the inclusion and exclusion of ties, are also produced \\u2014 note that these are both conditional in the event that the prediction (or evaluation) is valid.ObservationsIn terms of agreement rates, all three models seem quite close. Note again that these are conditional on the prediction/evaluation being valid. And so, one should \\u201cdiscount\\u201d these with the invalid and inconclusive counts.Gemini Pro and GPT-3.5 seem to be a bit more assertive than GPT-4 resulting in only 50\\u201360 ties to GPT-4\\u2019s 100 ties.Overall, it seems that Gemini Pro is up to snuff with GPT models, and would say that it outperforms GPT-3.5!Go now and evaluate your evaluators (and eat your veggies)!It is, for obvious reasons, important to evaluate your LLM evaluators, as these are now being relied upon to evaluate the performance of our LLM systems \\u2014 a broken compass is not really helpful!

The range of parameters for the large language models developed is from 7 billion to 70 billion.Reference Answer: The two primary objectives achieved in the work described in the abstract of \\u201cLlama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\\u201d are: 1. The development and release of a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) specifically optimized for dialogue use cases. 2. The demonstration that these fine-tuned LLMs, referred to as Llama 2-Chat, outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks tested and may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models, particularly in terms of helpfulness and safety based on human evaluations. The range of parameters for the large language models developed in this work is from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.Prometheus Feedback: The generated response is relevant to the user query and correctly identifies the two primary objectives of the work described in the abstract of \\u201cLlama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models.\\u201d However, it does not mention the demonstration of the fine-tuned LLMs outperforming open-source chat models on most benchmarks tested, which is a key point in the reference response. The range of parameters for the large language models developed is correctly identified, but the response does not mention the specific models referred to as Llama 2-Chat. So the overall score is 3.Prometheus Score: 3.0GPT-4 Feedback: The generated answer is relevant and almost fully correct. It correctly identifies the two primary objectives and the range of parameters for the large language models.\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The goal of using a LabelledRagDataset in evaluating a RAG system is to assess its performance in retrieving relevant information and generating accurate and coherent responses based on that information.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "Gemini 1.5 Flash", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"The end goal is to evaluate or benchmark a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\"\n]\n\nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    }\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "Gemini 1.5 Flash", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": true}}]}}}
